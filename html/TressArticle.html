                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <p>Before their marriage the many rat-like tendencies Charlie exhibited bothered Tress. She wasn't having it. Patient at first but, after he licked all the crumbs from the bowl of cat food, she knew they needed to do something.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, there was another enchantress who would be able to help! Along the coast of the Emerald sea they would find a large, private city. He glowed green all through the night. It was there one hope</p>
                        <p>Prepped and ready for another adventure, Charlie and Tress sailed together.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Clueless Charlie</h2>
                        <p>Charlie has never been the most intelligent Prince. Tress loves him still the same. As readers, we all find him endearing. The gifted cups, the sly smiling as he lies about his heritage, and the outright sabatoge on their trip with Hoid (the Cosmere mascot).</p>
                        <p>Acting as a rat after being transformed back into a human isn't the most surprising. But what is taking it to far? Locals report seeing Charlie run from a cat, eat 20 blocks of cheese, and even scrunch his nose!</p>
                        <p>No girl should ever have to deal with that! For months Tress has been seen smiling at all her public appearances — never flitching among Charlie's bizare behavior. (Come'on girl?! We can help!) They've done so many good things for our town since coming from their old home "the Rock", and still, we are missing out on all the fun! (Who even is Glorf? Why is Charlie mailing her?? — catch our take in the next issue!)</p>
                        <p>Without any improvement, recently, the couple has announced a vacation before their wedding next month. We all know it has to do with fixing whatever is wrong with Charlie. We don't need any more rats here.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The New Journey</h2>
                        <p>Our sources tell us they leave tomorrow for "The Emearld City." The mysterious bunker of a town north of here. It's easy to travel to, but beware, the city-folk are most parculiar. Their hermit behavior keeps most outsiders from ever talking to a citizen!</p>
                        <p>May they find the cure they are looking for. We need a normal Charlie! Follow to know what comes next (we have a friend watching the journey from a distance)</p>
